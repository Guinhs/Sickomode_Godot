# Sickomode_Godot

Yea, I know the name is wired but have some fun with the file. I took out very few textures due to copyright issues.
I will not continue to work on this project, so feel free to add or change things, but please not in the master_branch (is that right so).
I very new to GitHub therefore I may have missed some things
